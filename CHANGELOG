  - Added support for auto-defining methods based on hash keys in ActiveYaml::Base
  - Changed the :field and :fields API so that they don't overwrite existing methods (useful when ActiveYaml auto-defines methods)
  - Fixed a bug where ActiveFile incorrectly set the root_path to be the path in the gem directory, not the current working directory
